most of my work is basic and unfinished. I am dedicated to making larger, more thought out projects, so I have compiled a list of those which are in the works. the items in the list will become hyperlinks when the project is made public.

- `ardubasic` interpreted bytecode language compiled from an ASM-like syntax designed to run on embedded hardware
- `connexa` node based simulation engine for the web
    - `fluit` digital logic simulation
