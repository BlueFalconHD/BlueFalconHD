# Hey, I'm Blue ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub sanctuary. If you're here, you're probably a bit like meâ€” curious, passionate about code, and always on the hunt for the next thing to learn. I live in the US, and my days are filled with code, books, and learning.

You know, I've always found something poetic about programming. The way characters dance across the screen, forming strings and loops, it's almost like a language all its own. Speaking of languages, I've dabbled in quite a few: Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C#, C++, Swift, Java, and Kotlin.

So go ahead, explore my repositories, fork them, star them, or contribute. Let's make the digital world a little more interesting, shall we?

Feel like connecting? I'm just a tweet or an email away. Or, you know, just open an issue in one of my repos. Conversations are the best way to grow, after all.
